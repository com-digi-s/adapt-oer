# Adapt|OER

**Flask-Admin based web application** that serves as an **dashboard** for **e-learning content** produced with the **Adapt Authoring Tool**. The **Adapt Authoring Tool** integrates with **MongoDB** to store and manage learning materials, in different layers: courses, articles, blocks and components (interactive and presentative). The Authoring Tool only gives you an overview of courses, not their contents, which makes it hard to reuse them for Open Educational Resources (OERs) or any other format. Below is a breakdown of its **architecture, design patterns, and dependencies**.

---

## **Architecture Overview**

### **Tech Stack**
- **Backend**: Flask (Python) for API and server-side rendering
- **Database**: MongoDB (via PyMongo)
- **Admin Panel**: Flask-Admin for managing SCORM content
- **Frontend**: Flask templates (Jinja2)
- **Authentication**: Flask-Login for user management (assumes User is authenticated in Adapt Authoring Tool)
- **Internationalization**: Flask-Babel for multilingual support
- **SCORM Integration**: SCORM-compatible learning modules
- **Forms & Validation**: Flask-WTF and WTForms
- **File Handling**: Handles ZIP files for packaging quizzes and learning content

---

## **Key Components and Responsibilities**

### **Application Core (`app.py`)**
- Initializes the **Flask app**
- Configures database connection (`MongoDB`)
- Sets up authentication (`Flask-Login`)
- Defines **routes** for user authentication, course content, and quiz generation
- Serves as the entry point

---

### **Authentication & User Management**
- Uses `Flask-Login` to **authenticate a single admin user**.
- `@login_required` decorator ensures restricted access to the admin panel.
- **Session handling** is done via Flaskâ€™s built-in session mechanism.

**Key methods:**
- `login()` â†’ Handles login requests and verifies credentials
- `logout()` â†’ Logs out the user
- `load_user()` â†’ Retrieves authenticated user from session

---

### **Admin Panel (`Flask-Admin`)**
- Provides a dashboard for **managing courses, content objects, questions, and media**.
- Uses `ModelView` subclasses to manage MongoDB collections.

**Admin Views:**
- `CourseView` â†’ Manages e-learning courses
- `ContentsView` â†’ Handles learning content and taxonomy
- `QuestionView` â†’ Manages quizzes and assessments
- `PresentationView` â†’ Handles text-based learning components
- `GraphicView` â†’ Manages image-based content
- `GlossaryView` â†’ Stores glossary terms and definitions

---

### **SCORM Integration**
- Uses `pipwerks.SCORM` to track progress and completion within the LMS.
- Learning content is managed in **MongoDB**, where:
  - `contentobjects` store **course units**
  - `blocks` store **sections within units**
  - `components` store **questions, media, and text elements**

---

### **Content Filtering & Organization**
- `filter_components_and_blocks()` extracts and **groups components into learning blocks**.
- `get_related_content_index()` finds related **content items** in a course.
- `fetch_and_nest_content()` recursively structures **content hierarchies**.

---

### **Quiz & Assessment Handling**
- Supports dynamic quiz generation using `prepare_quizzes()` and `compose_quiz()`.
- Uses **Flask routes to generate, bundle, and deliver quizzes as SCORM packages**.
- Uses `transpile_bson.py` to **convert MongoDB BSON data into JSON-compatible format**.

ðŸ“Œ **Design Pattern Used**: **Decorator Pattern**
- Quiz data is **transformed, filtered, and enriched** before export.
